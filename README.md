# Gradient Descent from Scratch
Implementing Gradient Descent (Batch and Stochastic) from scratch in a Linear Regression Model

[Notebook](gradient_descent.ipynb)

## Description
This notebook explores manually applying gradient descent in a Batch and Stochastic way on a Linear Rgression Model.

## Goals
* Get in-depth knowledge of the underlying algorithm of gradient descent
* Get hands-on experience applying a Regression classifier
  * Made from scratch
  * From Sklearn
